# Pets Transfer System


## App description
Pet Transfer System will be an application for private non-profit organizations, that rescue and organize adoptions of pets, specifically exotic ones. Known systems are designed for cats and dogs. We would like to expand this type of application to exotic animals. Also, we would like to design a user-friendly interface (system found by us seems to be difficult to use, because of the non-intuitive interface).

* keep information about pets
* add information, add image, add labels to image profile (a type of animal)
* remove or archive profiles
